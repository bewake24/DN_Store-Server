## Story of the project
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Started for fun, I was bit curious about how an eccomerce store works in real life. My very first interaction of making eccomerce store happened in very first year of my college when I built my very first eccomerce website [viraldukaan](https://www.viraldukaan.com), but It was built on wordpress with the help of woocomerce. Since then I built 10's of eccomerce websites on wordpress for small businesses.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, this thing in wordpress is easy and convinient, not only for developers but for businesses as well. But most of the people doesn't even consider as a developement. In fact I'm one of those. And it's a crime to consider "connecting woocomerce with wordpress" and call it software developement. (I'm not saying wordpress is only limited to this thing.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, With some experience of working on wordpress and with small businesses I found a few problems and functionalities which I wanted to be in my store. but still I was bit consfused so without any end in the mind I casually started to code this thing. now I have clarity on few things and I'm slowly working on the project.

If you liked my story and motivation please give this repo a star üåü and follow me üòá to track my progress. Thank you ‚ö°Ô∏è
